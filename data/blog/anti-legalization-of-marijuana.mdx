# Intro

Cannabis is a psychoactive intoxicant that was illegal in Canada from 1923 until it was legalized for medical purposes in 2001. 
After Parliament passed Bill C-45, the Cannabis Act, on October 17, 2018, recreational cannabis consumption and sale became legal.

**Approximately 3 in 10 people who use marijuana have marijuana use disorder** (cdc.gov) 

For people who begin using marijuana before age 18, the risk of developing marijuana use disorder is even greater Marijuana has also been linked to mental diseases like psychosis and schizophrenia.
Unlike beer where the alcohol percentage is explicit, marijuana does not have a set THC level and those levels in marijuana on the market now are substantially higher, making it possibly more harmful to the brain.

## Concerns from John Hopkins University:
“It's not just smoked cannabis being sold. In medical dispensaries, there's cannabis ice cream, candy bars, and butter. My concern is that from a public health standpoint if you have a candy bar with 100 milligrams of THC in it, that seems a recipe for a 7-year-old kid getting ahold of it and having a very, very bad time.”

# A Lack of Regulations

> Many cannabis edibles companies are overstepping on marketing in an egregious way, putting consumers at risk and infringing on the trademarks of well-known and trusted confectionery brands

said Christopher Gindlesperger, the senior vice president of public affairs and communications for the National Confectioners Association.
Cannabis candies have become a growing concern in the recent years, due to companies now able to mass produce them, and without stricter regulations it will only get worse. 

According to Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, a 3-year-old was brought to a New Jersey ICU in December 2020 after consuming "cannabis candy that appeared identical to a Nerds Rope."

## Conclusion

There are not enough regulations on marijuana for it to be legalized, such as the varying and unlabeled levels of THC and the distribution of cannabis candies, which can prove an extreme danger to the youth. I believe that marijuana should have a stricter set of laws that regulate cannabis candies, such as putting a maximum level of THC that can be inside it, stricter distribution policies, and the fact that there is not enough medical research on the long term effects of marijuana.
