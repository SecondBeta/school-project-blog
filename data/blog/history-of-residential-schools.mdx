## Introduction

The Canadian government and Canadian churches built residential schools in order to aggressively assimilate Indigenous peoples, thereby avoiding the need to fulfil their legal and financial obligations and gaining control of their land and resources. Residential schools were one of many tactics for settlers to claim the land of the Indigenous people and can be traced as early as the 1830s. 

Mimicking the boarding school system implemented in the United States and British Colonies to convert masses of Indigenous and poor children into Christian “good industrious workers” (Atlas)

> …[I]f anything is to be done with the Indian, we must catch him very young. The children must be kept constantly within the circle of civilized conditions.”

– *Nicholas Flood Davin, Report on Industrial Schools for Indians and Half-Breeds, 1879.*

At its peak in 1931, 80 schools were in operation, although called residential schools they often consisted of industrial work. Many students went to school part-time and worked for the school the rest of the time: girls did housekeeping, boys did general maintenance and agriculture. 

This work, which was unpaid and involuntary, was presented to the students as practical training, but many of the residential schools could not function without it. Because of the lack of class time, most students had only completed grade five by the age of 18. Students were sent away at this point. Many people were discouraged from furthering their education.

### Emotional and psychological abuse was common at the schools. Physical as punishment, and numerous accounts of sexual abuse.

In the 1950s life experiences of the Indigenous students were becoming more widely recognized, this lead to the government banning half work/school days, forcible apprehension of children, and changes to the Indian Act.

Soon after in the 1960s the government transitioned from the school system to a "child welfare system", referred to as the "Sixties Scoop" due to the removal of Indigenous children without consent from parents.
During this time authorities would place Indigenous children with white middle-class families in an attempt to assimilate them. Overtime the Canadian government began to slowly phase out residential schools along with segregation, and began allowing Indigenous students into public schools.

## The residential school system in Canada lasted officially for almost 150 years

and its impacts continue to this day, although the last schools closed in 1996, the trauma, loss of language, culture, and mental/spiritual wellbeing are shared intergenerationally.

# Reconciliation

### [Beyond 94](https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/longform-single/beyond-94?&cta=1) is a project to monitor the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's 94 Calls to Action.

In order to guide governments, communities and faith groups down the road to reconciliation. Out of these 94 calls to action I adapted one to something I could do: "Educate people on the history of the Indigenous people".

Included in this call to action was to educate people on [Intercultural Competence](https://school-project-blog.vercel.app/blog/intercultural-competence).
By doing so I hope to help people learn and understand the importance of this call to action.
