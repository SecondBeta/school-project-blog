### Introduction

The Canadian government and Canadian churches built residential schools in order to aggressively assimilate Indigenous peoples, thereby avoiding the need to fulfil their legal and financial obligations and gaining control of their land and resources. Residential schools were one of many tactics for settlers to claim the land of the Indigenous people and can be traced as early as the 1830s. 

Mimicking the boarding school system implemented in the United States and British Colonies to convert masses of Indigenous and poor children into Christian “good industrious workers” (Atlas)

> …[I]f anything is to be done with the Indian, we must catch him very young. The children must be kept constantly within the circle of civilized conditions.”

– *Nicholas Flood Davin, Report on Industrial Schools for Indians and Half-Breeds, 1879.*
