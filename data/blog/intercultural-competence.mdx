## Intercultural competence is the ability to maintain one’s communicative effectiveness and relevance with people of varying cultures.

It is a skill that requires an individual to communicate without contravening the norms, values, or expectations of a relationship with someone of a different culture. In order to be Interculturally competent, it requires the individual to have a certain level of curiosity about other cultures and a commitment to change one’s behaviour.

Intercultural competence is a skill that ultimately determines success. Its lack can result in miscommunication, ignorance to the other party, and lost opportunities.
