# The Inventions and Contributions in Architecture from the Islamic World

What is today now recognized as Islamic architecture was influenced by Roman, Byzantine, Persian, and other lands conquered by Muslims in the 7th and 8th century. As Islam moved to Southeast Asia, it was also impacted by Chinese and Indian architecture. It developed distinct architectural features with unique additions, as well as surface decoration with Islamic calligraphy and geometric and patterned embellishment.

Islamic architecture can be found primarily in Arab States and Muslim-majority countries around the world, as well as in European countries with Arab or Islamic histories, such as Spain and Portugal due to the spread of Islam and muslim conquests.
Islamic architecture is a centuries-old category of architecture that is rooted in the principles of Islam, striking sculptural forms and often dazzling ornamental detail characterize Islamic buildings.


# Key characteristics of Islamic Architecture:

## Use of Water

More specifically fountains: were used to cool the air in hot climates, masking neighbouring city noise, and irrigating planting beds. It also ties closely with the structural intentions of Islamic architecture, for example in a mosque a row of indoor fountains will be used for [Wudu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wudu) 
the Islamic procedure of cleansing one’s body before prayer. And finally, fountains are used for decoration, especially when located in gardens which provides a prominent role in providing a dynamic changing surface to soften the geometric nature of the design.

## Gardens
Gardens are highly meaningful in Islam and have been described as a metaphor of Paradise or al-janna (the garden). Every time heaven is mentioned in the holy book of Quran there is a description of flowing water and fruit bearing trees, signifying their importance to man. 
Islamic gardens are traditionally enclosed by walls and commonly divided by either water channels or walkways, which took on many forms. 

These gardens would be often shaded, filled with fruit bearing trees, herbs, and plants. The purpose of these gardens is to create a calming environment for rest, reflection, and contemplation. Another type of garden design includes stepped terraces, in which water flows through a central axis, creating a trickling sound and animation effect with each step, which could also be used to power water jets.

## Tile Work

A final element of Islamic architecture is an attention to ornamental detail. Islam forbids the depiction of living things on mosques so design is done through tile work. 

Often reserved for interiors, is a lavish approach to decoration includes jewel-like tiles arranged into geometric mosaics, patterned brickwork and kaleidoscopic stones, and calligraphic adornments.

## The influence on our modern world

## Domes

A key feature of Islamic architecture, domes are placed on structures called pendentives that make it possible to fit a round dome on a rectangular or square room. Pendentives are often decorated with mosaic tiling. This was an important advancement and became used in nearly all mosques built today, a dome over a square base reflected the geometric symbolism of those shapes. 

The circle represented perfection, eternity, and the heavens. The square represented the earth.

## Modernism

> Islamic architecture is said to be genuine when it brings about a physical implementation of the message of Islam. Ideally, the culture which has been passed down through generations, which, when well expressed by Islamic architecture is the proper representation of the identity of Islam.
- *Gary Martin, Architect*

We now see modernized Islamic architecture in our world today, architects create modern designs while upholding the values of traditional Islamic architecture.

A popular example of modernized Islamic architecture is the award-winning 2013 cultural center designed by the Iraqi-British architect Zaha Hadid, who died in 2016.

## Because the Quran encourages believers to study and explore, Islam embraces modern science. As a result, Islamic architecture utilizes new construction technologies while remaining mindful of traditional building practices. In the modern world, such a blend of modernity and tradition opens up limitless design possibilities. In this approach, architecture would not lose its sense of place or its essence of time.
