Obesity in Canada is a rising epidemic, although a single law will not be able to have lasting effects, we hope a collective effort through various actions can have an impact on future generations.  

Obesity Canada reports that in the past 30 years, adult obesity has increased by at least three times. Over the coming years, it is expected that both the prevalence and the unexpected expenses of obesity rates will rise.

> Most of the foods that are marketed to kids are these ones that are high in fat, high in sugar, high in sodium, so that's what we're looking at 

(said Hasan Hutchinson, director general at Health Canada)

The proposed law includes:

- This law is not exclusive to television, as there are regulations on the amount of advertising per 30-60 minutes of programming.  But such limits do not exist online, and especially on websites frequently visited by children 13 and under, they can be bombarded with such advertisements with no limitations on frequency or volume.
- Limitations on marketing hours, (5:30 AM to 9:00 PM)
- As well as more transparency from advertisers to consumers
