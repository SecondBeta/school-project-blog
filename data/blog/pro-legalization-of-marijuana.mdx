_Title_: Pro Legalization of Marijuana

_Course_: Law

_Author_: Matthias

Why is this controversial? To start off there are different reasons and it may include medical use or just for fun. First, there are no reports of people actually overdosing on marijuana. There are different ways to consume Marijuana. You can either smoke it or eat it. Over time, this drug has been illegal and legal. Explained more in the court cases, many people smoke marijuana for medical benefits. It helps with pain treatment, help with cancer patients that have a loss of appetite. Many stated that this drug has helped them stay alive which plays a big part in the human rights act. 

Another topic I want to discuss why it should be legal is getting marijuana illegally and legally. If it is illegal, people who need it will need to get it illegally. This means getting it from drug dealers or from the streets which you may not even know if it is clean or not. This puts everyone at a greater risk and increases crime rate. For example, you need it to stay alive. Marijuana is not legal meaning you cannot get it legally but you need it to stay alive. You can get it from the streets which you may not even know if the product is clean or not. It may also put you at risk of getting hurt in the process. However, if it is legal, those people can actually get it prescribed to them which first, you know it is clean and second, it puts you in a lower risk of getting hurt. 

I also believe we should legalize it so that we are taught the effects and the commercials. Comparing alcohol and marijuana, we got drinking and driving commercials to educate us because alcohol is legal. However, marjjuana isn’t really talked about and it doesn’t have the same awareness spread like alcohol. Everyone knows to not drink and drive because we are taught that it is bad. Thats why, you rarely see people drinking while driving but there is not much info or being high and driving. I think it is because Marijuana is illegal and whenever we talk about it, we may risk getting in trouble since it is considered a drug.

He had seizures and Epilepsy. He couldn’t control them and marijuana helped him control them and stay alive. Parker turned to street dealers but their pot was not effective. So he grew his own illegal plants. On July 18, 1996, Ontario police entered Parker’s home and seized his 71 marijuana plants. At age 44, he was charged with possessing and cultivating marijuana under the then-Narcotic Control Act. Parker had been supplying marijuana to other epileptics. He refused to stop and told the court that this is against human rights to Life, Liberty, Personal Security which means  It guarantees our legal rights, which protect our personal autonomy and bodily integrity from laws or actions by the government that violate those rights
